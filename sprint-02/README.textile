h1. Sprint 02

h2. Take care of the design

h3. In this very first sprint we will:

* Review and improve the original rough sketch
* Design the page using just HTML and CSS

h3. Step by step guide:

*01* - The basics.

p. Rails 3 generates HTML5 code by default. So, let's also use it.

p. Preferably use a folder structure resembling the rails one, like this:

<pre>
+---public
|   +---images
|   +---javascripts
|   +---stylesheets
</pre>

p. Pages created in the @public@ folder will get it's resources
from the @images@, @javascripts@ and @stylesheets@ folders respectively.

*02* - The CSS strategy

p. You can, of course, use your own CSS strategy here.

p. Use CSS the way you feel more comfortable with.

p. I have made some experiments using  "oocss(oocss Home)":http://oocss.org/ and like
it's way of working. So I will use it.

*03* - Revisiting the page original rough sketch

p. Do you remember our "first sketch":https://github.com/marcric/ror3gangsclock/wiki/Basic-Idea ?

p. Thinking on how to implement it and some other practical stuff,
like "my current personal page layout":http://marcric.com/  for
instance, drives me to a new version that should look like this:

*04* - Get it done !

p. There are many sources of HTML and CSS around. Pick one and get the job done.

p. To stay in the path of this guide, there are some basics you page SHOULD have, like this one:

<pre>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Gangs Clock</title>
    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="images/myicon.ico">
    <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="images/myicon.ico">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="stylesheets/basic_html5.css">
  </head>
  <body>

    <nav>
      <p>Here is the nav bar place</p>
    </nav>

    <header>
      <p>Here is the header place</p>
    </header>

    <article>
      <p>Here is the main page body place</p>
    </article>

    <footer>
      <p>Here is the footer place</p>
    </footer>

  </body>

</html>
</pre>

fn1. If you are on lazy days, or have no HTML/CSS skills at all, you can grab
all that HTML/CSS work from this sprint @public@ folder.

fn2. After a few working hours I came up with this version:

!https://github.com/marcric/ror3gangsclock/wiki/r3gc_sprint-02_01.png!

p. And using the _cascading_ CSS properties it could be easily transformed into this one:

*Take your time make your tests and Your own improvements.*

*05* - Retrofit it into a Rails template.

* Now it's time to create the real working page.
* We will be using using Rails erb templates for that.

p. *It will be accomplished in "sprint 3":sprint-03.*

# You can find @r3gc01.htm@ and it's corresponding CSS file @basic_html5.css@
in the @public@ folder and in the @stylesheets@ subfolder respectively.
# You can find @r3gc02.htm@, it's corresponding CSS file @r3gc.css@ and
the optional blue skin CSS file @new_color_scheme.css@ in the @public@ folder
and in the @stylesheets@ subfolder respectively.

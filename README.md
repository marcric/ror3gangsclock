# RoR Gangs Clock

### What is Gangs Clock?

* People are connected by internet all over the World
* They are grouped in Gangs
* They are in different UTC slots
* It would be nice a dynamic interface pointing out which of my Gang members are on which UTC slot.
* I would like to develop it using Ruby on Rails

###  Project's side effect:

* It will be also, a step by step guide in developing, testing and publishing a RoR application.

### How it will be conducted?

I will use a design process, which primarily involves:

1. A very basic model
2. A Rough sketch
3. HTML/CSS
4. Style and images
5. Running code

### For more information, please, refer to the [Wiki][wk] page.

### How does it begun? Who is behind it?

* I have had the idea in mid 2009.
* It was based on a original work from [Satoshi Asakawa][ashbb]
* Originally published [here][gc1], then evolved into [here][gc2] and [here][gc3]
* Now, in the beginning of 2011 it is time to implement it in Rails.
* I will learn and share in the process, as always.

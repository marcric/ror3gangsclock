# Gangs Clock

### What is Gangs Clock?

* People are connected by internet all over the World
* They are grouped in Gangs
* They are in different UTC slots
* It would be nice a dynamic interface pointing out which of my Gang members are on which UTC slot.
* I would like to develop it using Ruby on Rails

###  So, what is this project expected to be?

* A step by step guide in developing, testing and publishing a RoR application.

### How it will be conducted?

I will use the 37signal's design process, which primarily involves:

1. A very basic model
2. A Rough sketch
3. HTML/CSS
4. Style and images
5. Running code

## First phase:

Sketch => Documents => Wire frames => Photoshop => HTML/CSS

## Second phase:

Start with a basic model. Split the model into: _**index**_, _**new**_, _**edit**_ and _**show**_ screens

## Third phase:

* For each screen
  * Sketch very roughly
  * Design in HTML from the inside out
  * Style incrementally
  * Use an image manipulation program when necessary
  * Then go back to HTML/CSS
  * Implement the HTML as templates in running code (erb)
  
## Strategy summary:

**Model => Sketch => HTML/CSS => Style => Refactor => Live Code**

## Who is behind this project?

_**[Marcos Ricardo][mr]**_ have had the original idea in mid 2009.
Now in the beginning of 2011 it is time to implement it, learning a bit more as always.

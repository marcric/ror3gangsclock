# Sprint 01

### In this very first sprint we will:

* Create the project
* Create the application "Home" page (a starting point only, not the final version)
* Get it working

### Step by step guide:

1. ```rails new r3gc```
2. ```cd r3gc```
3. ```rails s```
4. Access and test the application using: http://0.0.0.0:3000
   And clicking the "About your application’s environment" link.
   You should get something like this:
   ![Project Environment](https://github.com/marcric/ror3gangsclock/wiki/rails_environment.png "Environment")
